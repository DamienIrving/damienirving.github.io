Back in November 2006, I was a newly graduated physiotherapist.
While all my friends were off finding jobs in hospitals and sports medicine clinics,
I inexplicably enrolled in a Bachelor of Science.
You see, during the final year of my physio studies,
a friend of mine - who also happens to be an oceanographer - suggested that
I read Tim Flannery's best-seller, *The Weather Makers*.
Ever since reading that book,
I've been fascinated by the workings of the climate system. 

After finishing my undergraduate studies for a second time,
I worked at CSIRO for a few years
developing regional climate projections for Australia and various Pacific island nations.
I then completed a PhD at the University of Melbourne
looking at Southern Hemisphere planetary waves
(i.e. the winds in the upper atmosphere),
before taking up postdoctoral positions at CSIRO and then UNSW
to study anthropogenic changes in the global energy and water cycles.

I have a strong interest in data science education and open/reproducible research,
so during my spare time Iâ€™m an instructor, lesson author and
regional coordinator with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/),
maintain a blog ([Dr Climate](http://drclimate.wordpress.com/))
and online resource ([PyAOS](https://pyaos.github.io/))
about Python programming and research best practice in the weather/climate sciences
and help coordinate the [Research Bazaar](https://resbazblog.wordpress.com/),
which is a worldwide festival promoting the digital literacy
emerging at the center of modern research.
I'm also the Communications Coordinator for the
Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society.

It's impossible to study climate change and not feel compelled
to support political candidates fully committed to addressing the problem,
so I'm also a very active volunteer with the Tasmanian Greens.
